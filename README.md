# Games


In this project I analyzed the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. I identified patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This has allowed me to identify potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.

In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and we're planning a campaign for 2017.

The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates the content of a game and assigns an age rating, such as Teen or Mature.

**Data description**

* Name
* Platform
* Year_of_Release
* Genre
* NA_sales (North American sales in millions of USD)
* EU_sales (European sales in millions of USD)
* JP_sales (sales in Japan in millions of USD)
* Other_sales (sales in other countries in millions of USD)
* Critic_Score - (maximum of 100)
* User_Score (maximum of 10)
* Rating (ESRB)

**Test the following hypotheses**

- The average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

- The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.

**Conclusion**

From everything that has been analyzed, we can see some patterns of success in games. Patterns such as being of the action, sports or shooter genre in NA and EU, regarding the rating, prefer E or Mature and should be released on the newer platforms such as PS4 and XboxOne which are the ones that sell the most. But keep an eye on the PC platforms, which have been alive on the market for a long time, the WiiU, which could launch a new one if it dies, and the 3DS, which doesn't sell much but is still alive.

In Japan it's a different story, there you should keep an eye out for games with an E or T rating and mainly in the role-playing genre followed by action and platform, among the live platforms you should prioritize 3DS, wiiU, PS4, XboxOne and Pc in that order.

Always prefer PlayStation to Xbox in any group as it sells more.

Keep an eye on the PS4 XboxOne wiiU and 3ds platforms when they launch new platforms because in the first few years they usually increase game sales.

In short, a successful game in the US or NA would be a PS4 Action game and an E rating. In Japan, an E-rated Role-Playing game on the 3DS platform.
